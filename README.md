# hello-world
My first day at github.
This is an about me file with stuff that's not about me. So feel free to browse around.. elsewhere. If you don't think this is intresting enough for you. Honestly i couldn't blame you, i'm just trying to think of something to type on the fly, but this new keyboard on my XPS 15 is my first back-lit keyboard ive had in years, and is really distracting. like seriously i literally stare at it while i type, and while typing, i'll forget what i was gonna say. .. I mean type.
